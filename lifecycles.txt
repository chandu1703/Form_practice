There were three phases in react lifecycles of components:
1.Mounting
2.updating
3.unmounting


1.Mounting: when an instance of component is created and inserted into dom , it is invoked line by line 

methods in mounting:

1.constructor(props):
=>A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
=>It is used to initialise state and binding event handlers.
=>In constructor super(props) is used to directly overwrite this.state
=>In constructor this.state used to setstate

2.static getDerivedState From props(props,state):
=>In the initial stage if the component depends on the props is such scenario we do use this method.
=>we dont have this.setstate method
=> instead we pass state to a object, it returns new state /null.

3.render():
=> this is the only method we use in class component which is responsible for returning jsx 
and read this.state and this.props
=> cannot change state and make any ajax calls

4.componentDidMount():
=>This is called only once in the whole lifecycle pof a component.
=> invoked immediately after a component and all its children have been rendered.

2.UPDATING:
when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes made to state or props

1.static getDerivedState From props(props,state):
=> this gets called when a component is re-rendered

2.shouldcomponentUpdate():
=>dictates whether component should re-render or not.
=>the default behaviour of component is re-rendering so to stop this we can give it a value of false

3.render():
=> this is the only method we use in class component which is responsible for returning jsx 
and read this.state and this.props
=> cannot change state and make any ajax calls

4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,PrevState):
=>called right before the component is updated
=> captures info from dom
=> this will return a null/return a value , thos value is passed as 3rd paramter to next method.

5.componentDidMUpdate(prevProps,PrevState,snapshot):
=>called after render is finished in re-rendered cycles, only once called.



3.UNMOUNTING:

1.componentDidUnmount():
method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
=>in this cancelling any network requests removing event handlers,cancelling subscriptions .
